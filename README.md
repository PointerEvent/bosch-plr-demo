# Bosch PLR Demo

This is a demo implementation for communicating with Bosch laser range finders through web Bluetooth. The device used for this demo is a Bosch PLR 50c. Please note that this demo has not been tested with other PLR or Bosch GLM laser range finders.

Relevant documentation from the Bosch GLM/PLR Bluetooth App Kit can be found in the docs folder. The full development kit is available at [Bosch GLM/PLR Bluetooth App Kit](https://developer.bosch.com/products-and-services/sdks/bosch-glm-plr-app-kit).

As of now, the Web Bluetooth API is only supported in Chrome and Edge. However, support may be extended to other browsers in the future. [Live Demo](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/PointerEvent/bosch-plr-demo/blob/main/app/index.html)
